  title: 'Feelings, the RUT and what we do',
  transcript: `
When we feel uncomfortable emotions or think lots of negative thoughts we might also behave or act differently too. We might avoid places or people, withdraw or pull away from life and isolate ourselves; maybe we stop taking care of ourselves; or do things to distract ourselves that are harmful, like addictive behaviours. Or maybe we act aggressively to ourselves or to others.

There are many behaviours that people use to cope with situations and feelings that they have. Unfortunately some involve avoiding 'lifeâ€™, avoiding feelings, and they can be damaging, and ultimately just unhelpful to helping us feel better.

So when we get stuck in negative thoughts (or the RUT), and we push away our feelings and we turn to these unhelpful behaviours we end up fighting our emotions rather than coping with or managing them.
