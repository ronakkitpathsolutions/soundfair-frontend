  title: 'Strategy 1: Mindful allowing attitude',
  transcript: `
Allowing our feelings doesn't mean we need to enjoy experiencing them or let them take over. Instead, we are allowing our feelings to just be the way they are for now â€” letting the wave rise and fall.

Over the next three videos, we will look at three strategies to help us think differently about feelings, and allow our feelings instead of fighting them.
  
Strategy 1 is a mindful allowing attitude. We first need to adopt what we call a mindful allowing attitude, where we:
  
- Notice what is happening in the moment
- Label or acknowledge it; and
- Actively choose to be okay with it as it is for now

Being mindful of our feelings can be as simple as coming up with a phrase we tell ourselves when we notice uncomfortable feelings.

For example, when I'm feeling overwhelmed with work I tell myself:

"I notice I'm feeling really overwhelmed, that's okay, I can just let it be there"

You may have noticed I
- Stopped
- Took a breath
- Labelled my feeling out loud and
- Gave myself permission to feel it, and simply allow it to be there

You may have also noticed I used a calm, neutral voice.

I find when I stop, take a moment and calmly say it aloud to myself, that is just as important as the actual words or phrases I am saying to myself.
