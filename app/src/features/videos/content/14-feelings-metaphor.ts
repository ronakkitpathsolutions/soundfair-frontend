  title: 'Strategy 3: Feelings metaphor',
  transcript: `
Now it's time to get creative. Strategy 3 is all about you.

We call it the Feelings Metaphor. It's a way for us to symbolise our uncomfortable feelings and see them in a different way — as people, places or things that aren't super bad or life-threatening, like the 'feelings are like waves' metaphor we heard before.

Here are some more metaphors other people have used for their feelings:

Waves at the beach. We could struggle in the waves or go with them and surf it into shore.

A storm. We can't fight a storm—we have to let it pass and there is usually calm afterwards.

Cartoon characters. For example, my anxiety is called Worrying Wilma. When I feel anxious I say "Hey Wilma, how you doing?"

While all these metaphors are different they do an important job of showing it's okay to experience or have uncomfortable feelings around, and they will not last forever—like the storm, or the wave.

All three techniques— the mindful allowing attitude, slow breathing and the feelings metaphor—are great additions to your toolkit to help you cope when you experience uncomfortable feelings anytime or anywhere.

Don't forget — practise makes perfect. How can you practise your new allowing feelings techniques this week?
