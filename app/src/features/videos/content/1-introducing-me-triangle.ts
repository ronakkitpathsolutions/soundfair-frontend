  title: 'Introducing the Me Triangle',
  transcript: `
Let me introduce you to the ME Triangle, or the Manage my Emotions triangle. This is a useful diagram to help you understand any emotional experience you might have.

Now at the top of the triangle is a trigger. And triggers can be just about anything—from obvious external situations (like going to a party or sitting an exam) to subtle internal experiences, like random memories, thoughts, feelings or body sensations that just pop up for no reason.

A trigger can cause us to think, feel and act in different ways. There’s no right or wrong reactions—just lots of different ways we might respond.

So the Me Triangle helps us be aware of what is happening and our reactions. It's an essential first step and while nothing may change yet, we'll learn the skills to master each part of the triangle.
