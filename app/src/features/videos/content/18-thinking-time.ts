Thinking time doesn't mean 'sit quietly and worry a lot' — it's like a scheduled self-check-in.

We do our best thinking later when emotions are less intense and there's time and space to think things through — not in the heat of the moment. This is why Thinking Time is so helpful.

During Thinking Time, go over the list of thoughts and cross off things that no longer seem important — things we don't need to give thought to anymore.

People often discover that a lot of their negative thoughts are no longer important at Thinking Time. This is a powerful thing to learn and I hope this is something you discover too.

Of the thoughts that remain on your list, only think about them if you need to or want to think about them.

If more thinking is required, instead of falling into the RUT, try:
1. Problem-solving and coming up with productive action-oriented thinking; or
2. Helpful thinking. For example, thinking about things differently, in a more positive and flexible way; or
3. Continue to postpone and treat yourself well, if you can't problem-solve or think in more helpful ways.

Whatever strategy you use, try and stick within your time limit.

We'll learn more about problem-solving and helpful thinking in the next module. For now, let's get good at postponing your thoughts until later.

Remember — we don't do our best thinking in the heat of the moment. Later is when we can best judge if a thought is actually important and make a plan for what to do about it.
