  title: 'Tips to make new skills memorable',
  transcript: `
Congratulations, you've reached Module 7! In this final module we'll take everything we've learnt and make sure our new skills are memorable and easy to access so we can use them whenever we need them.

Hopefully you've been practising behaviours that support a strong base, and had a chance to practise your three key skillsâ€”allowing uncomfortable feelings, postponing repetitive unhelpful thoughts; and acting opposite to any unhelpful coping behaviours.

For new skills to become second nature it takes a lot of practise, and our Action Plans can help us with this when we are triggered.

To help you remember to use your action plan when you need it I find it's handy to: simply note down allow-postpone-act; or keep an image of the triangle somewhere you can easily see or access it every day, like your notebook, notes app or a sticky note on your wall.

It also helps to do an Action Plan for your usual triggers. Try and do an action plan for each trigger that often sets you off so you know exactly what to do when the time comes, rather than being caught by surprise.
