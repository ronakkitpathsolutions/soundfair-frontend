Aside from action-focused problem-solving, we can also engage in helpful thinking. To figure out if helpful thinking is a good approach, ask yourself—can I think about this differently? Or, are there more helpful or positive ways I could look at this?

We may not know the answer until we give it a go, but if our answer is yes or maybe then try helpful thinking.

Helpful thinking is most useful when we have a negative reaction that feels out of proportion for the situation.

It encourages us to pause, look at the facts, broaden our perspective and consider what happened? What am I thinking? What am I feeling? And how can I think differently?

The trickiest part of helpful thinking is usually 'how can I think differently'.

We've put together 12 helpful thinking questions you can ask yourself to challenge your initial thoughts and help you think differently. You don't have to ask yourself all 12 questions every time—they're simply options to support different ways of thinking.

For example, my favourite question is "what would you say to a friend". We tend to think in much kinder and more helpful ways for our friends, than for ourselves

You can access these helpful thinking questions anytime in Strategies.

Just like problem solving, we only do helpful thinking at Thinking Time, and stick to our time limit.
