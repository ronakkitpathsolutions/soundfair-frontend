  transcript: `
Place your feet flat on the floor, lengthen your spine, and take a comfortable yet alert posture.

Close your eyes if that feels comfortable, or drop your head and focus on a spot on the floor.

Now turn your attention to your breath. Breathing through your nose, focus on slowing each breath in and each breath out.

Gently lengthen each breath in and each breath out. Try to enjoy a slightly longer breath out, as you fully empty your lungs before inhaling again.

Follow your breath and do your best to direct your breath deep into your belly, rather than shallow in your chest. Don’t worry too much if this doesn’t come easily at first.

Continue your slow breathing, using your breath to slow down and pause.

I will now give you a few moments to simply follow your breath in and out... [10 second pause]

As you practise your slow breathing, you may notice that your mind wanders away from the breath to other thoughts, feelings or sensations. Just know that’s okay, because that's what minds do.

Simply acknowledge that your attention has drifted and gently re-direct it back to your breath, picking up on the next slow in-breath or next long out-breath.

It doesn’t matter how many times you need to bring your attention back to your breath. Whenever you're aware of it, just make the decision to simply focus on slowing your breath... [10 second pause]

If you notice your mind is getting caught on certain uncomfortable feelings like anxiety, frustration, sadness, even boredom...acknowledge the feeling and see if you can breathe into the feeling.

Use your slow breathing to gradually make space for the feeling and just allow it to be there. Do nothing more than simply breathe with whatever feelings happen to show up.

Practise this for a few moments [10 second pause]

As this slow breathing practise comes to an end, see if you can set the intention to slow your breath whenever you think of it, as you move on with the rest of your day.

Now, without rushing, whenever you feel ready, you can open your eyes.

[3 second pause]
