  transcript: `Changing our behaviour can be tricky at times.

It might feel scary to do things differently or just too much. Uncomfortable feelings and unhelpful thoughts can get in the way of making changes.

Here are my best tips to help make change easier.
  
1. Be specific and start with small steps. For example, if you want to get more active, you don't start by running a marathon. Instead, start by planning a specific time to take the dog for a walk around the block.
2. Don't be hard on yourself. If you don't manage what you planned, be flexible and pick something else or another time to do it.
3. Also, don't wait—just do! People often wait until they feel like doing something. But chances are you probably won’t feel like it. So remember the phrase "Action Comes First!" When we take action first, often the feeling of wanting to do it catches up.
4. Celebrate any small change you make - because change is hard, but it's worth it.
