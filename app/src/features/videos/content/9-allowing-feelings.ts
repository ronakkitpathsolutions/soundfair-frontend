  transcript: `
Before we master managing our emotions we first need to start thinking differently about our feelings.

Here are three very important points to know about our feelings:

One—uncomfortable feelings are normal! Our emotions are part of being human and can be healthy and helpful. They can help motivate us (like getting angry and standing up for something you believe in); alert us to potential dangers (like feeling anxious walking alone at night) or show the meaningful connections in our life (like feeling sad about a pet dying).

Uncomfortable emotions are normal and part of our ability to survive; but if these emotions are excessive and constant this may be a sign to pause and look at what else is going on for us.

Two—feelings are like waves! All emotions rise, peak, break, and subside. The peaks and intensity of some emotions are bigger than others. When we're in the middle of it all it might feel never-ending and unbearable to handle. This is why many people struggle with the feeling. It's good to remember that, just like waves, feelings are transient—they come and go if we let them.

Three—pushing away feelings doesn't help. When we push away our feelings we're fighting our feelings, and ourselves. For example, telling ourselves not to feel anxious when we are anxious doesn't generally help us feel less anxious; it can actually have the opposite effect and make us more anxious.

It's more helpful to learn how to allow uncomfortable feelings instead of fighting them.
