We said practise makes perfect — but how can we practise our skills if our triggers don't happen?

We've got two clever ways to practise, rather than wait or hope for our trigger to arrive:
1. Verbal rehearsal; and
2. Imaginal rehearsal

**(Verbal rehearsal)** Just like being in a play and learning your lines, saying the steps in your Action Plan aloud is an easy way to practise and remember.

You can rehearse by choosing a particular trigger and running through the following types of questions—what’s the likely feeling? How am I going to allow that feeling? What are the likely unhelpful thoughts? What am I going to say or do to postpone those thoughts? What would be a usual unhelpful coping behaviour? What’s an opposite action I can take instead?

**(Imaginal rehearsal)** Use your imagination. Close your eyes and see yourself being in a trigger situation, then imagine putting your action plan to work. Research shows our brains aren't very good at separating mental images from reality, so when we imagine something our brain feels it’s actually happening. Close your eyes, imagine being in a trigger situation, feel the uncomfortable, difficult feelings that go with it, then get out your action plan and work through the steps.

It's okay if the 'image' you see is fuzzy, or you're not a very visual person—you'll still be mentally practising the steps in your plan.
