  transcript: `
In the next two videos we'll unpack six unhelpful behaviours.

As we go through, take note of the behaviours relevant to you.  

**Avoidance** looks like avoiding specific situations, places, people or tasks, including procrastinating or things that aren't really dangerous. This can impact our confidence and life gets smaller.

**(Opposite actions to avoidance)** Get started by gradually facing situations, places, people or tasks step-by-step to build confidence. The exception is avoiding something that is genuinely dangerous (like walking down a dark alley alone at night)

**Safety behaviours** are things we do to prevent our fears coming true when we can't avoid a situation. They're sneaky and we often don't realise we're using them. For example, avoiding eye contact, not speaking up, only attending events if you can take someone, excessive preparing or seeking reassurance from others.

**(Opposite actions to safety behaviours)** Try dropping safety behaviours and give yourself a chance to see if it was really needed, or if it's hindering you and you can cope without it.

Safety behaviours are normal, but they become a problem when they're excessive or the feared outcome we're trying to avoid is unrealistic. If in doubt, ask yourself, "do most people do the same behaviour?" For example, "Do most people pre-rehearse everything they say before they say it?"

**Withdrawal** looks like pulling away from life. It can look like isolation, inactivity or other passive behaviours. This can impact our mental health and limit our ability to experience joy and pleasure.

**(Opposite actions to withdrawal)** Put effort into things you like and are fun to do. Try to engage in life, activities and with people.
