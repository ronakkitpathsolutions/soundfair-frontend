  title: 'Categories of uncomfortable emotions',
  transcript: `Part of managing our emotions involves allowing our feelings. This means giving ourselves time to notice, understand, and reflect on how we're feeling. Here, I'll share secrets to identifying our feelings and strategies to allow them so we can manage and cope better with whatever is going on.

In an earlier module, we mentioned uncomfortable feelings— like anxiety, sadness, shame, guilt, or anger. These feelings often come with physical sensations that we may notice first and make us realise we're feeling a certain way.

For example, when we're angry or nervous we might feel more physically active—maybe we fidget, feel our heart beat faster, or feel the need to go for a run.

If we're depressed or sad we might feel less physically active—maybe our body feels heavy and tired and it's really hard to get out of bed.

We can sometimes group uncomfortable feelings under three categories:  

- Anxiety
- Anger; and
- Sadness

These feelings are generally pretty uncomfortable, negative, and hard to deal with.

You might find what you feel doesn't always fit neatly into anxiety, anger, or sadness, and you also might experience one or all of these every now and then, or every day. Everyone is different, and feeling these feelings whenever and however you feel them is both normal and unique to you.
