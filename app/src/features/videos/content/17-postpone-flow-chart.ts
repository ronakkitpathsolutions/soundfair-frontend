Postponing might sound simple to do once or twice, but the trick is to keep on trying.

Here's an example and some tips to help you postpone like a pro.

As an example, I've just started worrying "I'm taking too long to explain this". That's okay, I'll write 'time explaining postponement' in my notes and say 'see you later'. Now I'm focused on speaking to you again.

After a while that same worry might pop up again. I'll just tally it to acknowledge it, say 'catch you later' and bring my focus back to you.

Simple phrases like 'see you later' help thoughts to pass easier. And using a calm, unbothered tone of voice helps too. These show I'm truly postponing rather than pushing or pulling my thoughts.

As part of postponement we need to set a Thinking Time. It's usually 10-15 mins we set aside later in the day to revisit and look over our list of thoughts from the day.

When setting a thinking time it's a good idea to avoid doing it just before bed, and to do an activity that makes you feel good afterwards. Like listening to music, or spending time with a friend.

Just know that all negative or unhelpful thoughts are postponable, even sneaky ones like 'I can't be bothered postponing!'

Any thought that doesn't make you feel very good can be postponed.
