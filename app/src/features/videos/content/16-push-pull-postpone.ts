  transcript: `
A RUT can happen when we respond to our negative thoughts by pushing or pulling:

We might pull the negative thought closer and give it lots of attention and energy. Or we might push the thought away to suppress or stop it, which has the opposite effect of making us think about it even more.

Pushing and pulling our thoughts makes us think about them more. Instead, what we need is to stop pushing and pulling.

A healthy alternative to pushing or pulling unhelpful thoughts is to postpone them. To put negative thoughts aside for later — just like a task we know we need to do but we can't do now because it's not the right time.

Instead of letting our thoughts spiral:  
1. Note down the thought in as few words as possible in a notebook or phone
2. Decide not to think about it now — pick a later Thinking Time to deal with it later
3. Use a simple phrase (like 'later') to help thoughts pass easier
4. Refocus attention on the current task
5. Repeat these steps. Make a list of different negative thoughts and make a tally any time the same thought pops up again. It might happen once or it might happen 100 times more.

By postponing we allow the initial negative thought to be there, but we also postpone getting into the RUT and instead give it a chance to resolve itself naturally like other thoughts do.
