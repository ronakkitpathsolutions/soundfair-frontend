  transcript: `
Hi, I’m Thareen and I’m a clinical psychologist registrar.

Just like uncomfortable feelings, it's really normal to have unhelpful thoughts.

Research shows our minds are very busy—we have thousands of thoughts a day and can't control what spontaneously pops into our head.

It's natural for our brain to search for warning signs. Sudden negative thoughts are our mind's way of trying to keep us safe.

We also might have very real problems going on. It's reasonable these problems may be on our mind.

But these negative thoughts become a problem when they get stuck in a RUT, or repetitive unhelpful thinking. Some might call this overthinking, ruminating, obsessing, over analysing, brooding or worrying.

Here's an example. I've got an exam coming up and the thought "What if I fail my exam" pops up. As a passing thought, I might feel some minor anxiety which might cause me to start studying.

But in the RUT I might start thinking I'll fail the entire class, I'll get kicked out of school, lose friends, my parents will be disappointed and I'll have no future. This might cause me to feel so anxious that I can't concentrate and therefore I don't study.
