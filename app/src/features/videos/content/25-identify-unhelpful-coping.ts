  transcript: `
While the explanations may sound simple, it can be really hard to know if a behaviour is unhelpful, and what a helpful opposite action may be. For example, while an unhelpful behaviour may be excessive sleeping, the opposite helpful behaviour is not to stop sleeping all together, but try to get a regular, balanced sleep routine.

Here are some tips to help you figure it out:
1. Does the behaviour reflect the person you want to be?
2. Would someone you consider resilient and emotionally balanced do this behaviour?
3. Is the aim or intent behind the behaviour helpful? Does it make me feel good and am I caring for myself? Or is the aim to suppress my feelings or am I hurting myself or others?
4. Does the behaviour match the situation? For example, a behaviour like avoidance would be justified for a real threat like getting into a strangerâ€™s car?
