  transcript: `
When faced with a trigger, instead of
- Pushing away our feelings
- Getting caught in the RUT, and
- Doing unhelpful things
  
Let's instead work on gaining skills to do 3 key things— to Allow, Postpone and Act:

1. Allowing our feelings, instead of pushing them away
2. Postponing unhelpful thinking, so we side-step getting caught in the RUT and instead purposely thinking in helpful, productive ways; and
3. Acting opposite to what our unhelpful thoughts and uncomfortable feelings might be urging us to do. And instead making sure we’re behaving in ways that are best for us.

So these skills will change the way we respond to triggers and help us cope better.

And remember—there's no right or wrong reaction to a trigger. But becoming aware of how we react gives us more choice to choose reactions that work for us.

So 'Allow-Postpone-Act' might sound simple, but can be hard to do in practise. But don't worry—you'll learn all these new skills step-by-step with bluurb.
