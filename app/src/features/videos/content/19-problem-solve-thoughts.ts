  title: 'Problem solve your thoughts',
  transcript: `
In the last module we learnt about interrupting our RUT (repetitive unhelpful thinking) by postponing our thoughts by allowing our initial thoughts, noting them down for later, refocusing on the present, having dedicated thinking time later, letting go of things that no longer seem important by crossing them off our list; and for things that still seem important, using problem-solving or helpful thinking, or continuing to postpone

This week we'll learn more about problem-solving and helpful thinking.

To decide whether to approach an unhelpful thought with problem-solving ask yourself:
1. Can I do something about this? Is it solvable?
2. Is the problem real and/or current?
3. Do I have some control over the problem?

If you answered yes or maybe to these questions we can try problem-solving this thought.

Problem-solving encourages action-oriented, structured and practical thinking rather than negative thinking. While it doesn't guarantee a perfect solution, problem-solving helps us generate options for coping with difficult situations. A lack of options can leave us feeling stuck, helpless and hopeless. Problem-solving gives us options. In the process, we may even realise the problem isn't solvable, so it may be a good time to move on to other things like helpful thinking or more postponement.
