  title: 'Introduction to unhelpful coping behaviours and acting opposite',
  transcript: `
Hey, I’m Ash, a provisional psychologist.

Today we'll unpack unhelpful coping behaviours and focus on the idea of acting opposite.

In this module we'll touch on behaviours that many people struggle with every day. Things like not taking care of yourself, being isolated, drug or alcohol use, self-harm, eating habits and so on. While we won't go into huge detail, it's a good idea to have some support available if you want or need it — like a friend, family member or support service you can talk to.

When it comes to managing our emotions, acting opposite can be more helpful than going with our feelings. While it's important to allow the feelings we naturally have, when it comes to our behaviour it's sometimes best to act opposite to what our feelings urge us to do, than act out the way we feel.

Acting opposite sounds simple in theory but can be difficult to practise. It helps to explore the unhelpful coping behaviours unique to you and identify helpful opposite actions that you can take.

Unhelpful behaviours generally fall within six categories:
- Avoidance
- Safety behaviours
- Withdrawal
- Numbing
- Excessive distractions; and
- Aggression

All our behaviours have consequences.


To work out if a behaviour is helpful or unhelpful, it can be useful to consider the consequences, particularly over the long term.

Some behaviours might give us some temporary relief but long term they make things worse for us - like making our life smaller, dropping our confidence, making the situation worse or making us feel bad about ourselves.
