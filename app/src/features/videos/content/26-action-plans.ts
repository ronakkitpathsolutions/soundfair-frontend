  transcript: `
You've now covered all the parts of the Me Triangleâ€”allowing feelings, postponing thoughts and acting opposite.

So, what happens now?

Now, we put it all into practise with an action plan.

The Action Plan draws all three skills together, and you can use it any time you experience difficult feelings and want to adjust how you would normally react.

Just like the Me Triangle, note down your trigger, thoughts, feelings and behaviours.

But now we can also add in how you can allow your feelings, postpone your thoughts and take specific opposite actions for the particular trigger you are facing.

Be specific, and try to practise Action Plans regularly
