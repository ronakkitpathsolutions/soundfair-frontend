  title: 'Helpful habits',
  transcript: `
There are three categories of helpful habits:
1. Feel good activities,
2. Lifestyle changes and
3. Challenging actions

Feel good activities make us feel good. Maybe they're fun, relaxing or make us feel happy and safe. It could be hanging out with friends or going to yoga to help lift the mood. All these things can make us feel good, but they're often the first things we stop doing when we start struggling with our mental health.

Our lifestyle also impacts our mental health. Think about how terrible we feel when we've had too little sleep, been inside too long or haven't showered in a day or two.

Making changes to our routine — like what we eat, how much we drink alcohol or use drugs, physical activity, taking care of ourselves, sleep and work-life balance — can change how steady we feel day-to-day.

The third category of helpful behaviours — challenging actions — are usually behaviours we don't want to do, but it usually feels better once we've done them.

This might be things like facing something we've been avoiding (maybe going to school or getting out socially); or maybe it’s getting started on something we've been procrastinating on, like assignments or study.

We might feel uncomfortable at first, but once we do the challenging action we feel a sense of achievement from doing it.
