  transcript: `Here are some simple steps to start problem solving a solvable problem:

1. What is it? Clearly define the problem
2. Ask 'what can I do about it?' Think of all the options—get creative and think outside the box
3. Narrow it down. Pick your favourite options
4. Weigh it up. What are the pros and cons of each option?
5. Decide. Pick one or more options to try. Remember, no option is perfect
6. Make a plan. Clear actionable steps of what you'll do and when
7. Have a go. Take an action
8. Check-in. Did it work? Do you need to try again, or move on?

Remember—we only do problem-solving during thinking time and stick to our time limit.`,
