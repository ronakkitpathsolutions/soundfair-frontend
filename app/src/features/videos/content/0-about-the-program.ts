Hi, I'm Dr Lisa Saulsman - a clinical psychologist and part of the team who developed this app.

This app is based on something called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (or CBT). Might sound fancy, but CBT helps all kinds of people learn ways to manage their emotions, handle stressful times and just generally boost mental health and well-being.

So we often get taught how to look after our physical health, but not so much our mental health, which is just as important. So we created this app to fill that gap.

As you work through this app you'll learn about yourself and gain the skills to face tough times better and stronger.

This app is split into 7 modules or topics, with activities in between, to help you learn and remember your new skills. If you stick with bluurb each topic should take about 15-20 minutes.

And the topics build on each other.

Together with bluurb you'll learn to
1. Understand your emotions
2. Build a strong foundation
3. Allow feelings
4. Postpone your thoughts
5. Problem solve + think in helpful ways
6. Act opposite to help you cope better; and
7. Putting it all together

By the end of it all you'll join thousands of people who have learnt these same important life skills.
