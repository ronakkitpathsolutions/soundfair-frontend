  transcript: `
You now have the skills and tools you need to manage your emotions in different situations.

Your good work doesn't stop here. Keep practising allowing, postponing and acting opposite, as well as those healthy habits for a strong foundation. Practise will keep your skills sharp and effective.

You can return to modules and refresh your skills whenever you need to.

We've created the Maintaining My Gains plan to help you get specific about what you practise, when you practise; and how often you'll practise your skills every day, week and month.

You can find the Maintaining My Gains plan in Strategies.

Thanks for joining us for this journey. I hope you take a moment to congratulate yourself for taking the time to improve how you cope with life's challenges.

What you have learnt here are just good life skills everyone should know for better mental health and well-being, and we hope you keep at it and that your mental health feels better for it.
