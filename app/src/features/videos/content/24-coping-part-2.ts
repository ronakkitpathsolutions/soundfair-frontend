  title: 'Unhelpful coping behaviours - part 2',
  transcript: `
**Numbing behaviours** numb our uncomfortable feelings through things like alcohol or drug use, binge or restricted eating or self-harm.

**Unhelpful distractions** go beyond procrastination and avoidance; they can look like excessive gaming, social media use or even excessive sleep or exercise. Doing anything in the extreme to distract ourselves.

A little bit of distraction is not always a bad thing, but excessive and constant distraction can make us feel worse and stop us learning healthy ways to cope.

**(Opposite actions to numbing behaviours and excessive distractions)** Look after yourself using self-soothing activities instead â€” like relaxation, music, exercise, spending time with your friend or playing with pets.

**Aggression** can be any situation where we lash out physically or verbally at ourselves, others or things around us. It makes situations worse.

**(Opposite actions to aggression)** When you feel aggression starting to rise take a timeout to settle yourself. Then see if you can revisit the situation in a calm frame of mind.
