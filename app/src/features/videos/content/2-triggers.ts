Triggers might lead us to think in unhelpful ways.

For example, we might have lots of negative thoughts that don't seem to go away; we might overthink, get really self-critical or worry about what others might think, or things going wrong.

So unhelpful thoughts are a problem when they hang around alot, rather than just pass on by. I call this the R.U.T — or Repetitive Unhelpful Thinking, RUT— where our mind goes over and over the unhelpful thoughts and wont let them go. So getting caught in a mental RUT is really common, but it's also really unhelpful for our mental health.

Now unhelpful thinking can also make us feel uncomfortable emotions—like anxiety or sadness, shame, guilt, anger or frustration. It makes sense that our first response when we feel these uncomfortable emotions might be to sort of push them away. But pushing away our feelings isn't really helpful and can actually make things worse for us.
