  transcript: `
Hi, I’m Sophia, a provisional psychologist.

Before we learn strategies to Allow-Postpone-Act we first need to make sure we're starting from a strong foundation.

So when we're triggered by something it can be hard to apply specific skills — like acting opposite or postponing our thoughts — especially if we're at a low point and feeling exhausted, overwhelmed or just generally unhappy.

Helpful habits and behaviours we practise every day can help set a stable foundation for our mental health to help us stand strong when life gets shaky.

When the foundation of our triangle is strong, the whole triangle is more stable and supported—it's much harder to topple the triangle when things get shaky.

How we behave day to day can play a big part in supporting the base of our Me Triangle.

Today we'll focus on healthy habits that can support us to be more emotionally resilient.
