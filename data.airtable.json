Write as if you are trying to convince another person that you are the best person for this task.\nOnce you’ve completed the task, reflect on how you feel about the challenge ahead of you. This technique is called self-persuasion, and research shows that after performing these kinds of tasks, we feel more confident in our ability to accomplish the challenge ahead of us!</li>\n</ul>",

Think of a negative way in which you think about yourself and hearing loss. \n<strong>Step 2. Describe the thought</strong>\nNext, we’re going to describe the stigmatising belief in one word. Reduce that negative self-evaluation down to one, hurtful word. You may choose “slow”, “worthless”, “useless”, “pathetic”, or “hopeless”. Try to pick words that you believe are true and apply to you. \n<strong>Step 3. Change the thought</strong>\nNow, once you have settled on a word, set a timer for 30 seconds. Now say that word out loud as many times as you can for 30 seconds.\n<strong>Step 4. Reflect on the feeling</strong>\nAfter the 30 seconds, describe to yourself how your experience of the word changed or didn’t change over that time. Perhaps you didn’t notice any change. Perhaps you noticed that the word slowly lost its meaning and became just a sound to you. Perhaps you noticed that your belief in the original self-judgement slowly became weaker.

      "content": "<p>Exercise, sports, and other activities in a group environment can be a wonderful way to tackle loneliness.\n<strong>Step 1. Find an activity you can enjoy while feeling connected</strong>\nConsider sports or exercises that rely less on auditory communication. This may include swimming, surfing, tennis, running, walking, hiking, gardening (yes, this counts as exercise!), bouldering, lawn bowls, bowling, or some group fitness classes.\nSearch online for group exercise classes or sports that are deliberately aimed at supporting people with hearing loss – while these aren’t universally available, larger cities are likely to have several local organisations. \n<a href=\"https://deafsports.org.au/sports/state-deaf-sports-organisations/\">https://deafsports.org.au/sports/state-deaf-sports-organisations/</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://deafsports.org.au/sports/national-deaf-sports-organisations/\">https://deafsports.org.au/sports/national-deaf-sports-organisations/</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;\nYou could also ask someone to join you for a weekly walk as a great way of connecting and getting exercise too.\n<strong>Step 2. Identify opportunities to engage and connect</strong>\nJoin the group (or your walking partner) and engage. Make sure you identify the opportunities for socialising and pursue those. Remember, the key is to build up new social connections while also drawing on the benefits of exercising.\n<strong>If exercise isn’t the best option:</strong>\nThankfully there are other groups we can join that can help reduce our experiences of loneliness and make us feel more socially included. A simple and effective approach is to join an arts program. \nIdeally, this will involve belonging to a group that meets frequently to work together or individually on a creative project, such as painting, knitting, sewing, woodworking, metalworking, mosaicking, or producing a play. Again, where possible, seek out opportunities in these programs to experience the social side – especially around collaborative work or meet-ups outside of the core meeting times.</p>",

Can you change the feel, shape, or location of the thought? Experiment for a while. Have some fun imagining it changing.\n<strong>Step 4.

Respect yourself and say how you feel **\ne.g., “I feel uncomfortable when we can’t talk easily.”\n<strong>Step 3. Let the other person know what you need</strong>\ne.g., “I look forward to catching up with you and would appreciate it if we could find somewhere you like where we can enjoy our conversation together.” \nNotice in this example, there are no accusatory statements starting with the word YOU, and we aren’t being aggressive in asking for what would suit us better. \nBut what if they still don’t meet our needs?\n<strong>Step 4. Evaluate your expectations</strong>\nSometimes it’s helpful to take a step back and check our expectations with the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have we clearly communicated our needs? &nbsp;If not, we can try asking respectfully in another way to get our request across without confusion.</li>\n<li>Are our expectations realistic? Can this change I’m requesting actually happen? What if there’s no other available table at the restaurant?</li>\n<li>Do we have any control over the situation or response? Can we change how someone else thinks or reacts? No! They control their own responses.\nIf you’ve evaluated your expectations and nothing further can be done, it’s probably time to start accepting these things that we can’t change.

      "content": "<p>A personalised ritual can help you to process feelings of grief and loss.\n<strong>Step 1. Identify the loss</strong>\nFirst, identify the losses that you feel have come about because of your hearing loss. These losses can be trivial or profound. It can help to start with the smaller losses before confronting larger changes.\n<strong>Step 2. Find a symbolic action</strong>\nNext, identify a symbolic action or set of actions you can take to mark and respect this loss. Aim to find something that will take at least 30 seconds to complete, the key is to have some time to acknowledge and reflect on your loss. A short action can just be a starting point, you may like to develop a longer set of actions (that take minutes or hours) to provide more time to reflect. There are a range of actions that you can take, and the more meaningful the action feels to you, the better. This is a highly personal activity, so finding something that feels right is important.\n<strong>Step 3. Marking the start and end</strong>\nDecide on something to mark the start and end of the ritual, such as taking a deep breath, lighting a candle, or simply saying two short phrases like “Let’s start now” and “Let’s end here”. The key here is to deliberately separate the ritual from the rest of your day, which can help you give the ritual your full attention.\n<strong>Step 4. Perform the ritual</strong>\nFinally, perform the ritual as often as you like. You may only wish to do it once, or you might like to use the ritual daily. You may find several emotions - grief, anger, sadness, hurt, laughter - come up during the ritual. This is completely okay, and part of the complex process of grieving.</p>",

Create a list</strong>\nIn this option, list situations where your hearing loss causes difficulties. Try to reflect on any recent challenging experiences where your hearing loss was impactful and write down exactly what was difficult. Think about your actions, the actions of others, your thoughts, and your feelings. Your aim is to accurately describe what happened for you, without trying to change it or judge it as good or bad.\n<strong>Option 2. Talk to someone close</strong>\nThis next option involves talking to your partner, family member, or a close honest friend. They might also notice some things that are new to you! If you need some prompts to get you started, you might like to ask them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What tells you that my hearing loss is causing some trouble?</li>\n<li>When did you first notice that I had a hearing loss?</li>\n<li>How does the hearing loss affect you?</li>\n<li>What do you do when my hearing loss is causing trouble that I might not know about?</li>\n<li>What can we do together when there is some difficulty with my hearing loss?\n<strong>Option 3. Talk to an audiologist</strong>\nVisiting an audiologist is one part of raising your awareness. They can give you an accurate measurement of what your ears are actually doing, and they can provide information on challenges, changes in your own and others’ behaviours, and new opportunities for communication and connection. Some questions that you can begin with include:</li>\n<li>What do other people with my hearing loss experience?</li>\n<li>What are the ways in which my hearing is similar to and different from people with ‘typical’ hearing? </li>\n<li>What situations may I have trouble hearing in?</li>\n<li>What can I tell people that will help us communicate with each other?</li>\n</ul>",

Notice judgements **\nIf you find yourself engaging in judgements, remind yourself that emotions don't have to be good or bad. Then return your attention to describing the emotion itself.\n<strong>Step 3. Engaging in the present moment</strong>\nOnce you feel you've observed the emotion fully or feel ready to move on, return your attention back to the present moment. If you struggle with this, a good idea is to bring your attention back to the rest of the world by engaging in and becoming aware of your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, or sound.\nBy practicing this activity, you can learn to better cope with unpleasant emotions, noticing how they change over time, and observing what they tell you about how you feel about the world around you.</p>",

In this way, we’re not dismissing our worries throughout the day, but putting them aside for a time when we can give them our full attention.\n<strong>Step 1. Schedule a worry time</strong>\nDecide on a time, duration, and place to dedicate to your worry time. For example, you might choose to worry at 5pm for 15 minutes in the backyard under the lemon tree. Avoid choosing times close to your wake or sleep times and avoid locations that you regularly visit. You might even like to set yourself a reminder or schedule this time in your diary.\n<strong>Step 2. Training your worries</strong>\nTry to notice when you are worrying. Once you have noticed that you are worrying, acknowledge the worry and decide to return to it in your allotted worry time. It can help to write it down. Train yourself to disengage from the worry and return to the present moment. It can be helpful to find something to do to disengage from the worry like starting a new task, engaging in a conversation, or using a relaxation technique.\n<strong>Step 3. Go full worry</strong>\nFinally, at your allotted worry time, worry, worry and only worry. Don’t do anything else for that period of time. You may find that things that worried you earlier are no longer bothersome and that’s okay! You can choose something else to worry about. If you run out of things to worry about, that’s good as well—feel free to end the session early. Once the worry time is over, that’s it. Return to step 2 until the next scheduled session.</p>",

Naturally, we humans make quite a few errors and biases.</p>\n<p>Fundamental attribution errors occur when we overemphasise the role of internal factors (like personality, traits, abilities, or motivations) and underestimate the influence of external factors (like situations, environments, or events) when explaining others' behaviour.</p>\n<p>Self-serving bias involves attributing positive events and successes to internal factors (I avoided that falling tree because I am a wonderful driver) but attributing negative events and failures to external factors (that fence moved in front of my car!).</p>\n<p>Actor-observer bias describes how we tend to attribute our own behaviour to external factors (I failed that exam because it was unusually difficult) while attributing others' behaviour to internal factors (they failed that exam because they were too lazy to study).</p>"
